# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

What are you trying to do and why? (plain English without jargon)

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

## 4. Potential Impact

If the project is successful, what difference will it make, both technically and broadly?

## 5. Challenges

What are the challenges and risks?

## 6. Requirements for Success

What skills and resources are necessary to perform the project?

Basic ML knowledge, python progrmaing, hardware to run model (3090/ Google collab), data manipulation skills

## 7. Metrics of Success

If we can imlement the dataset given into a model with more advanced complexity and layering then expiremneted in the paper then we succeed

## 8. Execution Plan

Step 2: Split the provided data into training data, test, and validation data 

Step 3: Improve our model to use more then 1 layer GRU, which is what the paper did

Step 4: Make the model improve with new data with no retraining
