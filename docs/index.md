# Abstract

Smartwatches are increasingly used in our daily life. However, how to accurately recognize "air writes" text by fingers when users are wearing a smartwatch has not been handled. The challenges are the user shifts such as writing habits and noise introduced in the background, e.g., the users are walking. We will design a machine learning model to handle IMU data collected by the smartwatch to recognize "air writes" text by the users.
